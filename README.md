# Task List Application

This Task List application is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage tasks with attributes such as Title, Description, Status, and Due Date. The application is built with React for the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend. The React frontend is served directly by the ASP.NET Core backend, making it a unified application that can be deployed and run from a single server.

## Overview

The Task List Application provides a simple interface to manage tasks. Users can:

- View a list of tasks with the ability to sort by title and due date.
- Create new tasks with details like title, description, status, and due date.
- Edit task details.
- Delete tasks from the list.
- Search tasks by title or description.

The backend is powered by ASP.NET Core, which also serves the static files generated by the React frontend. This setup allows the application to run as a single unit.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **.NET 6 SDK**: Required to run the ASP.NET Core Web API.
- **Node.js and npm**: Required to build the React frontend.
- **MongoDB**: A database to store task data.

2. **Restore NuGet packages**:

    ```bash
    dotnet restore <.csproj>
    ```

3. **Configure the database**:

    - Open `appsettings.json` and configure the connection strings for MongoDB.
    - Example for MongoDB:
