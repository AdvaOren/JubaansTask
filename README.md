# ToDo List Application

This Task List application is a full-stack web application that allows users to manage tasks with attributes such as Title, Description, Status, and Due Date. The application is built with React for the frontend and ASP.NET Core Web API for the backend. The React frontend is served directly by the ASP.NET Core backend, making it a unified application that can be deployed and run from a single server.

The backend is powered by ASP.NET Core, which also serves the static files generated by the React frontend. This setup allows the application to run as a single unit.
